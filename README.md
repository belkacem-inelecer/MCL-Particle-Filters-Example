# Particle Filter for Robot Localization

This repository contains a Python implementation of a **Particle Filter** applied to **robot localization** in a 2D space. It provides an example of **Monte Carlo Localization** (MCL) using a particle filter, where the robot tries to estimate its position based on noisy sensor measurements and motion information.

The notebook walks through the following steps:
1. **Prior knowledge**: A vague idea of the robot's initial position is represented using a Gaussian distribution.
2. **Measurement update**: The particle filter is updated based on sensor measurements, adjusting the weights of the particles using a likelihood function.
3. **Prediction step**: The particles are predicted to new positions using a simple motion model.
4. **Resampling**: To focus on the most likely particles, the filter resamples the particles based on their updated weights.
5. **Recurse**: The process is repeated in a loop where measurements and motion are continuously integrated.

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates how a particle filter can be applied to localize a robot within a 2D world. Using a simple motion model and noisy sensor measurements, the particle filter approximates the robot's position by updating the belief (or posterior) over time. The key steps involve prior sampling, measurement updates, motion predictions, and resampling to focus on the most likely particles.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you'll need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install the dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/particle-filter-robot-localization.git
   cd particle-filter-robot-localization
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. You also need to install Plotly for visualization:
   ```bash
   pip install plotly
   ```

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, open the notebook `particle_filter_localization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and run each cell to observe the Particle Filter process. The notebook is interactive and visualizes the robot’s localization in real-time using Plotly.

### Key Sections:
- **Prior knowledge**: Initial particles are randomly sampled to represent a vague belief about the robot's location.
- **Update with measurements**: When a sensor measurement (position) is available, the particles are weighted based on their likelihood given the measurement.
- **Prediction**: The particles are then moved using a simple motion model (in this case, circular movement).
- **Resampling**: To focus on the more probable particles, resampling is performed based on the weights.
- **Recurse**: The filter process repeats, constantly refining the robot's localization.

## Explanation

### Prior Knowledge as Samples
In the beginning, we have no precise information about the robot’s location, only a vague idea that it's near the origin. This prior knowledge is represented by a Gaussian distribution, from which we sample 300 particles (representing possible positions). The particles are displayed on a 2D scatter plot.

### Update with Information from a Measurement
We assume that the robot has a sensor that measures its position in the x-direction, with noise (Gaussian). Based on this noisy measurement, we compute the likelihood of each particle’s location using Bayes' theorem. The likelihood is used to assign weights to each particle, reflecting how well the particle matches the sensor's measurement. The weighted particles are displayed.

### Prediction with a Motion Model
At each time step, the particle filter makes predictions about where the robot will move, based on a simple motion model. In this case, the robot moves in a circular path around the origin. This motion model is used to propagate the particles forward in time by using simple Euler integration steps.

### Resample to Get Unweighted Samples Again
After updating the particles’ positions based on the motion model, the particles still have associated weights. To focus on the most probable locations, we resample the particles based on their weights, creating a new set of unweighted particles. This step ensures that less likely particles are discarded, and more likely particles are kept.

### Recurse: Update with a New Measurement
As new measurements are taken, the particle filter repeats the update, prediction, and resampling steps. Each new measurement refines the robot’s estimated position, and the particles converge to the correct location.
